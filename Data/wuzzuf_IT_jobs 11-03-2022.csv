These days we are looking to make those ASICs more general and programmable. Cisco Common ASIC Group is looking for a Senior ASIC Verification Engineer to drive existing projects and engage in new development of our next generation switching systems.As part of the ASIC team, you will be developing the ASICs at the heart of each of these switch products. There are only a very few teams worldwide that implement such devices. Every time you access the Internet, chances are, your data's been through one of our switches.Who You'll Work WithYou will work with Cisco’s best-in-class switching solution team. Our team is responsible for driving integration of the Nexus systems and ACI with software, including OpenStack, Docker, and Open vSwitch, to help our customers build multitenant clouds.Who You AreYou are a talented, motivated ASIC verification engineer to join the team and contribute to the verification of very complex ASICs. You will have a Design Verification background, hands-on experience in System Verilog and UVM methodology, with in-depth knowledge of C++, scripting, as well as ASIC design and verification flow.You’ll be part of Cisco Common ASIC Group, focusing on developing and upgrading various test benches and contributing to different aspects of verification infrastructure.You will collaborate closely with the design team and the hardware team to verify the ASIC in simulation, in emulation and during ASIC bring up.Responsibilities Include:Create block level test benches including components like drivers/monitors/sequencesMaintaining existing test benches for block level and/or cluster levelUpgrading test benches to accommodate new featuresEnd-to-end verification of various design blocksDeveloping test plans, cover pointsUpgrading/updating configuration/reset sequences (APIs)Collaboration with designers/verification engineers to perform cross-block verificationWriting tests, and debugging regressionsContributing to top level verificationBe a part of emulation testing effortsEducation and Experience Required:Master’s degree in EE (Electrical & Electronics) or CE (Computer Engineering) with 2+ YoE in Design VerificationBachelor’s degree in EE or CE and 3+ YoE in Design VerificationKnowledge and Skills:Hands-on and deep understanding of System Verilog and UVM methodologyAbility to construct testbench including scoreboard, agents, sequencers, and monitorsAbility to debug issues independentlyProficient in functional coverage and constrained random DV environmentsBasic scripting experience (Python, Perl, shell programming)Nice to have C, C++ programming and debugging skillsGood written and verbal communication skillsCollaborative and team-focused, with the drive to learn and growWe Are Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.
