This includes software engineering and software development activities for platform functionalities and systems functions of the SW Platform.<br><br>System Functions in this terms are all open and proprietary functions which are<br>•necessary for E/E integration into a vehicle: e.g. programming, diagnostics, coding, vehicle clock/time sync management, service discovery, communication via standard links like ethernet etc.<br>•necessary as a supplemental function: e.g. logging of data to external logger boxes (tracing), debugging capabilities (e.g. via JTAG)<br>•necessary for internal operation of the system, e.g. process management, CPU/RAM/Flash quota management, scheduling<br>•necessary for the safe operation (e.g. ASIL requirements, watchdogs, diagnostic monitors)<br>•necessary for the secure operation (e.g. HSM configuration, secure boot concepts for all relevant SoCs etc.)<br><br>The software platform is based on an QNX operating system, which hosts a commercial Adaptive AUTOSAR stack including OEM specific functionalities for<br>•programming<br>•diagnostics<br>•coding<br>•vehicle clock/time sync management<br>•service discovery<br>•logging<br>•process management, CPU/RAM/Flash quota management, scheduling<br>•safety and security functionalities like certificate management, HSM configuration, secure boot, etc.<br><br>The software stack developed within this project shall be deployable to different underlying hardware platforms.
